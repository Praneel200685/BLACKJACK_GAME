# BLACKJACK_GAME
This traditional Blackjack game pits the player against the computer dealer in a Python-based simulation. The goal is to accumulate cards totaling as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Players can choose to "hit" to take another card or "stand" to keep their hand. Face cards count as 10 points, and aces can be 1 or 11. The dealer follows set rules, hitting until reaching at least 17. The game determines the winner by comparing hand values while handling busts, wins, and ties with clear logic. It can feature a console or GUI interface and uses Pythonâ€™s random module to shuffle and deal cards
